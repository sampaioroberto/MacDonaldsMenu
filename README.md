# MacDonaldsMenu

An iOS application that shows MacDonalds Menu.

# Installation

Before we open the project, we need to setup some dependencies.

## Gemfile

This project uses Gemfile to manage Ruby gems. To install the gems from Gemfile, open your terminal and run the following command in the root folder of the project:

`bundle` or `bundle install`

## Cocoapods

We're using Cocoapods for Swiftlint and for running KIF Tests. To install the pods using the Gemfile run:

`bundle exec pod install`

Now you can open MacDonaldsMenu.xcworkspace.

# Swift Package Manager

The project uses SPM for Kingfisher and Snapkit.

# Gitflow

The image of the Gitflow I used in the app can be found at the root folder of the project.

# Tests

I chose XCTests for Unit Tests
